I'm currently participating in the **National AI Student Challenge (NAISC)**, organized by **AI Singapore**, with support from **IMDA** and other partners. 

This initiative has engaged over **2,000 students** and aims to:

- Empower youth with practical AI knowledge
- Provide real-world exposure through hands-on challenges
- Foster innovation and creative problem-solving
- Nurture the next generation of AI users, practitioners, and creators

Through this challenge, I’m gaining valuable experience working on real-world AI problems, collaborating with like-minded peers, and exploring impactful use cases for AI in industry and society.

I’m also taking part in the **SCDF Hackathon**, a national-level innovation challenge focused on **emergency response, public safety**, and **urban resilience**.

This hackathon provides a platform to:

- Develop tech-driven solutions to enhance Singapore’s emergency services
- Collaborate with domain experts from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF)
- Apply design thinking, GenAI, and data-driven strategies to critical real-world problems
- Present innovative solutions that could potentially be adopted by SCDF or its partners

Participating in both hackathons is helping me sharpen my technical, teamwork, and critical thinking skills — all while contributing toward meaningful public good.
