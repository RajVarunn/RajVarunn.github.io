I particularly enjoy running and playing ball sports, with a special fondness for football. My sports background includes being part of the track and field team at Singapore Polytechnic, where I also served as president of the long-distance team. Additionally, I was the vice-captain for cricket at Ping Yi Secondary School and currently captain my own football team formed with friends. I love exploring new sports and am currently part of the Singapore Institute of Technology football varsity team.\n\n\nPhotography\nI recently discovered a passion for photography, which I‚Äôve come to truly enjoy. It offers me a fresh perspective and the unique ability to freeze moments in time, allowing me to capture memories that will accompany me through life. I particularly enjoy taking portraits and photographing architecture. I‚Äôm also eager to explore videography in the future!\n\n\nTraveling\nI enjoy traveling because it gives me the chance to engage with different cultures and experiences. Every trip offers new experiences and opportunities that deepen my awareness of various lifestyles. Traveling allows me to make lifelong connections and to connect with people from all walks of life."

Designed to encourage early language development in children, it promotes:\n\nSpelling and word recognition through maze navigation\nCognitive growth via spatial-word association\nAudio support that vocalizes target words to enhance listening and pronunciation\n\nThe system emphasizes sound software architecture, using SOLID principles and design patterns like Factory and Observer, while maintaining a clean separation between engine logic and game functionality."

It demonstrates core OOP principles:\n\nEncapsulation\nInheritance\nPolymorphism\nAbstraction\n\nUsing a manager-based architecture, each subsystem (e.g., rendering, input, logic) is independently extendable. While areas like dynamic level generation could be enhanced, the engine is well-suited for scalable game development."
