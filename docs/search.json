I particularly enjoy running and playing ball sports, with a special fondness for football. My sports background includes being part of the track and field team at Singapore Polytechnic, where I also served as president of the long-distance team. Additionally, I was the vice-captain for cricket at Ping Yi Secondary School and currently captain my own football team formed with friends. I love exploring new sports and am currently part of the Singapore Institute of Technology football varsity team.\n\n\nPhotography\nI recently discovered a passion for photography, which I’ve come to truly enjoy. It offers me a fresh perspective and the unique ability to freeze moments in time, allowing me to capture memories that will accompany me through life. I particularly enjoy taking portraits and photographing architecture. I’m also eager to explore videography in the future!\n\n\nTraveling\nI enjoy traveling because it gives me the chance to engage with different cultures and experiences. Every trip offers new experiences and opportunities that deepen my awareness of various lifestyles. Traveling allows me to make lifelong connections and to connect with people from all walks of life."

    "text": "In completing this assessment, I extensively utilized Generative AI (GenAI) tools — primarily ChatGPT by OpenAI. I chose this tool because of its advanced natural language capabilities, accessibility, and ease of integration with my workflow. ChatGPT is known for providing structured and articulate responses across a wide range of domains, including programming, writing, and research.\n\n\nHow GenAI Helped Me\nGenAI was incredibly useful in various stages of this project:\n\nIdea Structuring: I used ChatGPT to help outline the content for multiple sections, including my project descriptions and skills breakdown.\nMarkdown and Quarto Assistance: When formatting pages like index.qmd, projects.qmd, and skills.qmd, ChatGPT guided me on proper syntax and provided ready-to-use code blocks.\nCSS Support: Helped me enhance the visual design of my portfolio by improving layout, typography, spacing, and overall consistency—making the site look more polished and professional.\nEmbedding Tips: When I needed to embed PowerPoint slides, ChatGPT suggested using Google Slides and OneDrive methods via iframe, which was extremely helpful.\n\n\n\n\nBenefits of Using GenAI\n\nTime Efficiency: It helped me avoid spending excessive time on technical troubleshooting or blank-page syndrome.\nIdea Expansion: Sometimes I started with a rough idea, and ChatGPT expanded it into well-structured content.\nCoding Aid: When I was unsure about certain HTML/Markdown structures or Quarto configs, GenAI assisted with the syntax.\n\n\n\n\nChallenges I Encountered\n\nOver-Reliance Risk: It’s easy to depend too much on GenAI suggestions without critical evaluation.\nGeneric Responses: Occasionally, the responses lacked depth or originality, especially in more creative or reflective tasks.\nFormatting Adjustments: Although the tool suggested Markdown/HTML snippets, some fine-tuning was needed to fit the Quarto environment exactly.\n\n\n\n\nLooking Ahead\nI believe GenAI tools like ChatGPT will continue to play a crucial role in my academic and professional journey. In future:\n\nFor Study: I can use it to understand complex topics, generate practice questions, and get help with assignments.\nFor Work: It can help in writing reports, automating documentation, generating code, and even assisting in communication tasks.\n\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nUsing GenAI has been a highly enriching experience. While it’s important to apply personal judgment and creativity, I see these tools as powerful collaborators — especially when used ethically and responsibly. They can boost productivity, expand thinking, and make digital creation more accessible for everyone."
