The team built an NLP model to distinguish positive and negative tweets from an open-source Twitter dataset. The project involved:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis** to understand the dataset  
- **Feature Engineering** to generate valuable features  
- **Modeling** using SVM & Random Forest classifiers  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning** via grid search  
- Integration of **VADER sentiment scoring**, **offset multiplier fusion**, and **custom rule-based random forest models** to improve accuracy

These enhancements led to the selection of the best-performing model by the end of the notebook, with meaningful improvements in sentiment classification accuracy.

This project showcases *Spell & Seek*, an educational Java game built on the abstract game engine created in Phase 1. Designed to encourage early language development in children, it promotes:

- Spelling and word recognition through maze navigation
- Cognitive growth via spatial-word association
- Audio support that vocalizes target words to enhance listening and pronunciation

The system emphasizes sound **software architecture**, using SOLID principles and design patterns like **Factory** and **Observer**, while maintaining a clean separation between **engine logic** and **game functionality**.

## ðŸ§© Abstract Game Engine

<iframe src="https://1drv.ms/p/c/3bc8d5e73005a3fd/UQT9owUw59XIIIA76XQAAAAAAAvzcfbmUiATTNg?em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777" width="476px" height="288px" frameborder="0">This is an embedded <a target="_blank" href="https://office.com">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target="_blank" href="https://office.com/webapps">Office</a>.</iframe>

We developed a **modular abstract engine** that serves as a solid foundation for future games. It demonstrates core **OOP principles**:

- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Abstraction**

Using a manager-based architecture, each subsystem (e.g., rendering, input, logic) is independently extendable. While areas like **dynamic level generation** could be enhanced, the engine is well-suited for scalable game development.

## ðŸ“Š Job Market Analysis

![Jobs](images/jobs.png){width=350px style="margin:10px"}

Our team created a software platform to explore current **job trends** and predict outcomes in the employment landscape. Key features:

- **Interactive dashboard** for analyzing demand, qualifications, and salary trends
- **Predictive salary model** based on experience, age, and job type
- **Job recommendation engine** using classification algorithms based on user input (e.g., experience, gender, education, expected salary)

This tool provides career insights for individuals and strategic data for organizations looking to understand or forecast workforce dynamics.
